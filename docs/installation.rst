Installing YAtiML
=================

YAtiML is available from PyPI, and you can install it using pip:

.. code-block:: console

  pip install yatiml


or add it to the dependencies of your project in your usual way.

Changes between versions are listed in the file CHANGELOG.rst. YAtiML adheres
to `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/>`_. Starting from version 1.0, you
will be able to count on a stable API as long as you pin your dependency to a
major version.
