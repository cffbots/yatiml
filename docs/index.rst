   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to YAtiML's documentation!
==========================================================

YAtiML is a small Python library that works with ruamel.yaml, adding functions
for automatic type recognition to it. YAtiML is not a schema language like XSD
and Relax-NG are for XML, or JSON Schema is for JSON. YAtiML is also not an
Object/YAML mapper (YAML is already an object serialisation system, so you don't
need an extra library for that). However, YAtiML does solve the same kind of
problems, and more, so if you are looking for a schema language for YAML, YAtiML
may actually be what you need.

YAtiML supports Python 3.4 and later.

If you use YAtiML for scientific work, we ask that you cite it. We have provided
a CITATION.cff file to help you do so quickly and easily.
